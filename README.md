# Machine-Learning-Comparison
To ensure a fair comparison of machine learning algorithms, it is important to evaluate each one using the same methodology on the same data. This can be achieved by using a standardized testing framework for all the algorithms.
This repository contains a notebook which will give us a clear idea of how to start with small projects on machine learning.

In the example below 6 different algorithms are compared:

Logistic Regression
Linear Discriminant Analysis
K-Nearest Neighbors
Classification and Regression Trees
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines

The problem is a standard binary classification dataset called the Pima Indians onset of diabetes problem. The problem has two classes and eight numeric input variables of varying scale,
